<h2>Wealthify</h2>
Wealthify is a personal finance tracker web app designed specifically for students to efficiently manage their wealth. With Wealthify, users can track their income, expenses, and overall financial health from a single, intuitive interface. The app leverages Firebase Authentication for secure login with Google or Email/Password, and Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval. It features Ant Design for a sleek and responsive UI, making it easy to add, manage, and categorize transactions. Users can also visualize their spending and income trends with interactive charts and export their transactions to CSV for offline analysis.

To get started with Wealthify locally, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/sakshampurohitt/wealthify.git, then install dependencies with npm install. Set up Firebase by creating a project in the Firebase Console, enabling Authentication methods, creating a Firestore database, and adding your Firebase configuration to src/firebase.js. Finally, start the development server with npm start.

I am looking for contributors to help enhance Wealthify. Specifically, I need assistance with:
<l>
-Bug Fixes & Enhancements: Fix existing bugs and add new features such as transaction editing and deletion.
-Financial Charts: Develop or enhance charts to better visualize total balance, expenses, and income trends.
-UI/UX Improvements: Refine the user interface for a more engaging experience and implement custom tags for expenses and income.
-Additional Features: Improve CSV export options and suggest or build new features that could benefit student users.
-To contribute, fork the repository, create a new branch for your changes, push to your forked repository, and submit a pull request with a description of your updates.
